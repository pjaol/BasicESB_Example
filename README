The BasicESB_Example is an RSS aggregator that clusters results based on the title
of each item in the rss feed. 

The objective is to show how a module can be reused in the BasicESB multiple times with
just a config change (RSSFetcher).

And how a limiter can be used to take the output of all modules and combine them.
(RSSCluterModule)
